I am currently a Technical Lead, R&D at *Reverie Language Technologies*, that is letting me explore all that I love about languages and linguistics. I have previously enjoyed working on a range of projects in Computer Vision and Robotics in both industrial and academic setups. 

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani where I took up courses and projects related to Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning and Computer Graphics. Through my interships and work, I have had the opportunity to implement projects in these fields. Details about my [projects](#projects) and [experience](#experience) below.
